Finding the ground state for a general spin Hamiltonian for particular geometries.

So far: 

Plots of ground state energy as the DMI is varied for two-particle systems. 

Analysis of energy dependence of ground state on orientation and size of DMI, relative to Heisenberg coupling.

Analysis of dependence of ground state vector as DMI is turned on. Displays continuity of model with Heisenberg.
